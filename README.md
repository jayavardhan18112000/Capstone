# AI-Driven Late Delivery Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages advanced data science and artificial intelligence techniques to predict late delivery risks in supply chain logistics. By analyzing shipping, order, and customer-related data, the model identifies key factors influencing delays and provides actionable insights to optimize operations and enhance delivery performance.

## Key Features
- Predicts delivery risk ("on-time" or "late") using AI-driven machine learning models.
- Employs advanced feature engineering to capture temporal and logistical patterns.
- Reduces late delivery risks by over 20% through optimized predictive modeling.
- Supports real-time integration and scalability for dynamic logistics systems.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Science Techniques:** Feature engineering, statistical analysis, and one-hot encoding for preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Ensemble methods such as Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and CatBoost for superior performance.
- **Impactful Insights:** Identification of key predictors like shipping timelines, order characteristics, and customer behavior.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Outlier detection, normalization, and fine-tuning to improve prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Data Description
The project uses three datasets:
1. **Main Dataset:** Contains shipping, order, and customer-related details.
2. **Logs Dataset:** Tracks customer interactions and engagement metrics.
3. **Description Dataset:** Includes metadata on product categories and specifications.

Key predictive features include:
- Shipping mode, days for shipping, order time, and delivery time.
- Financial metrics like order profit, sales per customer, and discount rates.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy with Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and CatBoost models.
- Demonstrated significant reduction in late delivery risk by fine-tuning top predictors.
- Provided insights into optimizing shipping modes and order prioritization.

## Applications
- Real-time risk prediction for supply chain logistics.
- Optimization of delivery schedules to reduce delays.
- Insights for enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Future Work
- Integrate live shipping and delivery data for real-time updates.
- Incorporate external factors like weather and traffic into the predictive model.
- Develop scenario-based simulations for proactive risk management.
